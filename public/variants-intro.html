		<h2 id="h2-why-diffentiating-through">Why differentiating through an optimizer is actually as complicated as it
			sounds</h2>
		<p>
			In this section, we want to gain some understanding of what it actually means to differentiate through
			fine-tuning function \(U_\tau\).
			Recall the gradient that MAML requires us to compute:

			\[ \nabla_\theta\, \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_\tau \left[\, \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(\phi)
			\,\right]
			.\]

			Expanding the inner term by applying the chain rule yields

			\[ \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(\phi) = \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(U_{\tau}(\theta)) = \nabla_{U_{\tau}(\theta)} \mathcal{L}_{\tau,
			\text{test}}(U_{\tau}(\theta))
			\nabla_\theta U_{\tau}(\theta) .\]

			Here, \( \nabla_{U_{\tau}(\theta)}\, \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}} \) is the gradient of the
			loss function of task
			\(\tau\) at the optimized parameter \(\phi\)
			and \(\nabla_\theta U_{\tau}(\theta)\) is the Jacobian of the optimization
			algorithm (it describes how a change of \(\theta\) is locally transformed
			into a change of \( \phi \)).
		</p>
		<p>
			Even if we assume that the optimizer takes only one gradient descent step (as in vanilla MAML), this term
			becomes

			\[ \nabla_\theta U_{\tau}(\theta) = \nabla_\theta (\theta - \alpha \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{train}}(\theta) ) = I - \alpha \nabla^2_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\tau,
			\text{train}}(\theta). \]

			Hence, MAML requires us to compute second derivatives in order to optimize
			\(\theta\), which is computationally costly, especially
			in high-dimensional problems (such as learning neural nets).
		</p>
		<p>
			If we don't restrict ourselves to making just a single gradient update,
			the term becomes slightly more complicated. Let \(k\) be the number of updates
			we make and
			\( \phi^i \) describe the \(i\)th step of gradient descent, then:

			$$\begin{align}
			\nabla_\theta \phi^k &= \frac{\mathrm d\phi^k}{\mathrm d\theta}
			= \prod_{i=1}^{k} \frac{\mathrm d\phi^i}{\mathrm d\phi^{k-1} }\\
			&= \prod^{k}_{i=1} \left(
			I - \alpha \nabla^2_{\phi^{i-1}}\mathcal L_{\tau,\text{train}}(\phi^{i-1})
			\right)
			\end{align}$$
		</p>

		<p>
			There are two prevalent methods of calculating the meta-gradient.
			Both methods have their unique limitations which we will discuss briefly.
		</p>

		<h3>Calculating the Jacobians for every update step</h3>
		<p>
			The most straightforward approach is to calculate the Jacobian in each update
			step. Considering the product from above, we can iteratively multiply
			the new Jacobian term with the accumulated Jacobian matrix, ending up with the full optimizer Jacobian after
			\(k\) update steps.
		</p>
		<p>
			The big issue with Jacobian matrices, however, is that they are huge! For deep neural
			networks, it is not uncommon to have parameters in the magnitude of millions.
			Though we may not need to store the complete square matrix and can
			potentially sparsify it, the resulting number of required entries
			for a large model will still be enormous.
			This places a huge burden on the computational and memory resources.
			One advantage is that the required memory only depends on the model size
			but not on the number of update steps.
		</p>
		<p>
			To find out how one can get around calculating any second-order derivatives,
			take a look at <a href="first-order.html#start">FOMAML</a>
			and <a href="reptile.html#start">Reptile</a>.
		</p>

		<h3>Calculating the Hessian vector product directly</h3>
		<p>

			In order to circumvent the need for calculating and storing a Jacobian
			matrix, we can also use a different approach:
			If we take a step back and look at what we ultimately want to calculate,
			we recognize that we are not really interested in the Jacobian itself,
			but in a product of the Jacobian (first) with a gradient vector (second factor):

			\[ \nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(\phi) =
			\left(
			\frac{\mathrm d U_{\tau}(\theta)}{\mathrm d\theta}
			\right)
			\left(
			\nabla_{U_{\tau}(\theta)} \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}
			\right)
			.\]
		</p>

		<p>
			This fact can be cleverly exploited.
			One key ingredient is a function which we will call
			\( \mathrm {sg} \) (for "stop gradient"). This function is actually very simple
			(in the implementation as well as its properties): It simply returns its input value
			but stops the flow of the gradient during backpropagation.
			In TensorFlow this function is implemented with <code>tf.stop_gradient()</code>
			while in PyTorch one can use the <code>.detach()</code> function on a tensor
			to produce the same effect. Each time we want to evaluate a gradient of
			\(\mathrm{sg}(f(x))\) with respect to any variable \(x\) and with any function
			\( f \), we assume
			\[
			\frac{\mathrm d\, \mathrm {sg}(f(x))}{\mathrm dx} = 0
			.\]

			This allows us to transform the gradient. By adding a term of this form
			(third line) and applying the product rule (fourth line),
			we arrive at the following equations:

			\[
			\begin{align}
			\nabla_\theta
			\mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(\phi) &=
			\left(
			\frac{\mathrm d \phi}{\mathrm d\theta}
			\right)
			\nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}} (\phi) \\
			&=
			\left(
			\frac{\mathrm d \phi}{\mathrm d\theta}
			\right)
			\mathrm{sg} \left(
			\nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(\phi)
			\right)
			\\
			&=
			\left(
			\frac{\mathrm d \phi}{\mathrm d\theta}
			\right)
			\mathrm{sg} \left(
			\nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(\phi)
			\right)
			+
			\left(
			\frac{\mathrm d\, \mathrm{sg} \left(
			\nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(\phi)
			\right)}{\mathrm d\theta}
			\right)
			\phi
			\\
			&=
			\frac{\mathrm {d}}{\mathrm {d} \theta}
			\left(
			\phi\, \cdot
			\mathrm{sg} \left(\nabla_{\phi} \mathcal{L}_{\tau, \text{test}}(\phi)\right)
			\right)
			.
			\end{align}\]

		</p>
		<p>
			Essentially, instead of backpropagating a change in the vector-valued output
			(as one might do when calculating a jacobian), we backpropagate
			the dot product of the gradient on the test loss (treating it as a constant)
			and the task parameter which the inner (task) optimizer produced. As a consequence we obtain the desired
			gradient
			without ever computing the large Jacobian matrix.
		</p>
		<p>
			One way to think of this is the following:
			By moving from the current meta-parameter in the opposite direction of this derivative
			(which is - as we now know - equal to the meta-gradient; i.e., doing gradient descent),
			we indirectly move the task-parameter in a direction to better align it with the
			negative gradient on the test loss.
			If the two vectors (test loss gradient and task-parameter) are unaligned
			(e.g., the task-parameter is aligned with the negative test loss gradient),
			then moving into the the direction of the negative gradient will further
			minimize the dot product. Hence, minimizing the dot product and
			minimizing the test loss is actually equivalent when doing gradient
			descent.
		</p>

		<p>
			While this approach does not require us to store or calculate Jacobian matrices,
			it also comes with a downside:
			Calculating the derivative of the dot product requires backpropagating
			through the whole optimization chain. Hence, we need to store the
			complete computational graph and can't employ an iterative calculation as
			with the Jacobian matrices.
			The memory burden of this increases linearly with the number of updates
			the optimizer takes. It should also be mentioned that while this approach
			does not require the calculation of Jacobians, it does still require
			second-order derivatives.

			graph of the optimization procedure, take a look at
