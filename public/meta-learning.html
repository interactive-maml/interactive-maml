		<p>
			In this section, we explain why MAML is "model-agnostic" and thereby gain a bit more of an overview of the
			meta-learning field.
			Metric-based and model-based approaches
			force constraints on either the sampling (e.g., episodic training)
			or the architecture of the model. MAML, on the other hand, requires only one
			very general assumption: the model needs to be optimizable by a gradient-based
			optimizer. Hence, it has been introduced as "model-agnostic". But notice that MAML is still not
			completely free of assumptions. It is important to view the method in the context of the field to understand
			what
			really sets it apart in terms of design, assumptions, and approach, which is what we will consider on this page.

		<h4>Metric-based approaches</h4>
		<p>
			The core idea of metric-based approaches is to compare two samples in a
			latent (metric) space: In this space, samples of the same class are supposed
			to be close to each other, while two samples from different classes are
			supposed to have a large distance (the notion of a distance is what makes
			the latent space a metric space).
			<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/nips/SnellSZ17,koch_siamese_2015,DBLP:conf/nips/VinyalsBLKW16"></d-cite>
		</p>

		<h4>Model-based approaches</h4>
		<p>
			Model-based approaches are neural architectures that are deliberately designed
			for fast adaption to new tasks without an inclination to overfit.
			Memory-Augmented Neural Networks and MetaNet are two examples. Both employ
			an external memory while still maintaining the ability to be trained
			end-to-end.
			<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/SantoroBBWL16,DBLP:conf/icml/MunkhdalaiY17"></d-cite>
		</p>

		<h4>Optimization-based approach MAML</h4>
		<p>
			MAML goes a different route: The neural network is designed the same way
			your usual model might be (in the many-shot case). All the magic happens during the
			optimization, which is what makes it "optimization-based".
			As a consequence, unlike metric-based and model-based approaches, MAML lets
			you choose the model architecture freely.
			This has the great benefit of being applicable not only to
			conventional supervised learning classification tasks but also
			to reinforcement learning
			<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/FinnAL17"></d-cite>.

			In the following figure, you can find a selection of meta-learning methods
			that tackle
			few-shot
			learning, their performance on Omniglot, as well as your own accuracy score from the starting page.

			Next to recurrent <d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/SantoroBBWL16"></d-cite>
			and attention-based models <d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/nips/VinyalsBLKW16"></d-cite>,
			there is also optimized-based meta-learning, of which
			MAML (marked in
			<span style="color: #d62728">red</span>)
			<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/FinnAL17"></d-cite>
			is the most famous representative.

					This figure shows the results of different methods on the Omniglot dataset.
					If not stated differently, you see the results of 20-way 1-shot, but some
					differences in the evaluation procedure exist.
					As usual, accuracy numbers need to be taken with a grain of salt as
					differences in the evaluation method, implementation, and model
					complexity may have a non-negligible impact on the performance.
				</p>
				<p id="caption_generative_stroke_model" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					The generative stroke model was introduced in the paper, which also
					introduced the Omniglot dataset. The model is based on a latent stroke representation
					(including the number and directions of strokes). While it is an
					interesting approach, it can hardly be generalized to other
					few-shot problems.<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/cogsci/LakeSGT11"></d-cite>
				</p>
				<p id="caption_hierachical_bayesian_program_learning" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					The same authors improved the model by learning latent
					primitive motor elements and called this process "Hierarchical
					Bayesian Program Learning" (HBPL).
					While the accuracy was greatly increased, it also
					is focused on symbol learning.
					<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/nips/LakeST13"></d-cite>
				</p>
				<p id="caption_siamese_nets" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					Siamese Nets consist of two identical networks which produce a latent representation.
					From the representations of two samples, a distance is calculated to
					assess the similarity of the two samples.<d-cite bibtex-key="koch_siamese_2015"></d-cite>
					The result (accuracy of 88.1%) results from a reimplementation of the method
					making it more comparable.
					<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/nips/VinyalsBLKW16"></d-cite>
				</p>
				<p id="caption_matching_nets" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					Matching Networks also work by comparing new samples to labeled
					examples. They do so by utilizing an attention kernel.
					Though the second version of the paper is cited here,
					it was first published in 2016.
					<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/nips/VinyalsBLKW16"></d-cite>
				</p>

				<p id="caption_prototypical_networks" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					Prototypical Networks use prototype vectors to represent each class
					in the metric space. The nearest neighbor (i.e., the closest prototype)
					of a sample then determines the prediction.
					<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/nips/SnellSZ17"></d-cite>
				</p>

				<p id="caption_memory_augmented_nets" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					Memory-Augmented Networks (MANNs) use external memory to make accurate
					predictions using a small number of samples.
					<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/SantoroBBWL16"></d-cite>
				</p>

				<p id="caption_meta_nets" class="fewShotMethods-reference">
					Meta Networks utilize a base learner (task level) and a meta learner
					as well as a set of slow and rapid weights to allow
					meta-learning and task-specific concepts.
					<d-cite bibtex-key="DBLP:conf/icml/MunkhdalaiY17"></d-cite>
